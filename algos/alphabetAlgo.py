# GIVEN A SENTANCE... WE NEED TO SCORE THE WORDS AND RETURN THE HIGHEST SCORED WORD....

# RULES
# save capitalization
# check for special chars
# get the score non caps bias


# What was the person thinking when they discovered cow's milk was fine for human consumption... and why did they do it in the first place!?
# ANSWER = consumption
